      singeIVDosing: The simplest model is of first order elimination following a single IV dose 
        since we only have to consider the elimination process and we start with all the drug 
        in the blood. There are many assumptions in all PK models and it is good to keep that in mind. 
        You may ask “How is it possible that a given drug is guaranteed to behave in this way?” 
        and you’d be right! There are many variables to consider. Gut metabolism, proportion of the molecule in salt form, 
        hepatic extraction ratio. But for now, start with the single IV dose and you will begin to understand the most critical 
        relationships between PK parameters used in drug design and clinical descision making.

      oralDosingPlasmaTimeCurve: After a while thinking deeply about the single IV plasma-time curve 
        you will be ready to think about the more general but more complicated single oral dose plasma-time curve. 
        This introduces another variable which is the absorption rate constant but it is still a relatively simple situation 
        since we are not looking at multiple doses or considering other factors affecting drug disposition.

      intravenousInfusionAndEffectOfClearance: In these IV infusion curves you can see the effect of different values of clearance 
        on the steady state concentration of a drug. So drugs that have different clearance values that are dosed at the same mg/hour 
        dose rate will settle at different steady state concentrations.

      nonLinearPharmacokinetics: In these IV infusion cruves you can see the effect of different values of clearance 
        on the steady state concentration of a drug. So drugs that have different clearance values that are dosed 
        at the same mg/hour dose rate will settle at different steady state concentrations.

      multipleOralDosing: Finally we consider multiple oral dosing. This is a much more difficult thing to work with 
        because there are several variables to consider when plotting the resultant plasma-time curve. 
        In the example below the equation for multiple oral dosing is used taking into account the 
        regular dosing interval and deriving from that which dose number in the series we are up to at any given time-point.
